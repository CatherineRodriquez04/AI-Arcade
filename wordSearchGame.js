//word search!

/***
 * IDEA:
 *
 * generate word search
 * - answers -> up, down, sideways,... diagonal
 *
 * give player 60sec to find a word first round
 * - if player fails to find one word -> moves to AI
 * - AI will have 5-10sec to display answer
 *
 * - second round and onward player has 30sec
 *
 * - if player finds a word adds 10-15 sec to timer
 *
 * see who gets the most words at the end
 *
 * 3 types:
 * - 10 words -> east
 * - 15 words -> medium
 * - 20 words -> hard
 * 
 * "CONSOLE",
      "RETRO",
      "DEVELOPMENT",
      "ALGORITHM",
      "PIXEL",
      "QUARTER",
      "HIGHSCORE",
      "ARCADE",
      "JOYSTICK",
      "ARTIFICIAL",
